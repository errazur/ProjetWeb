Hello, my name is Cyril Valette i am 22yo, i am currently in training to 
become a web and web app developper in Callac Soft College. 
For the last past years i was working as a temporary worker in differente 
company. I am going to introduce you to my web project wich is call 
stars of football. 
The idea of the project its the user will create a club of football 
and manage the footballer,training, transfer, tactics, league. 
Users can also make match between the two Users.
To make the project i used Laravel as the framework for my project 
with all the positive point like all the librairy : 
Eloquent, tailwind css, Livewire ect.
To program the project i used PHP, HMTL, CSS, JS, MYSQL.
The point of the site is to make the information to the user really
easy to understand at first but if he look far away there would be
more details information.
There will be few pages of each things you can manage in the club.
